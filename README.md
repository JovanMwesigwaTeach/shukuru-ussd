# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Hi, are you doing some sort of maintainance on the USSD feature?

I've been using ngrok for my app all along when testing and the callback was working smoothly, but for some reason today its not connecting at all

I've tried to test the call back using my local machine, my desktop postman app and all the postman app in the browser and the callback connects very well with the backend. But when i try using the sandbox it oesn't seem to work...

I have tried to create new channel codes, changed to new ngrok urls, but all do not work in the Africa talking sand box
